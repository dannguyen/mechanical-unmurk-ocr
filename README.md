=====================

Murkily un-murk those murky documents

For the OCRing of scanned documents where speed, accuracy, privacy and cost are all factors of your consideration.

Done in Ruby, for now.

External components:
- [Tesseract 3.0](http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/): To OCR the scanned files
- [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org): To parse the generated hOCR files
- [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php): To break the original scanned images into their component hOCR entities


Synergestic proactive paradigms [used to sound important](http://www.snpp.com/episodes/4F12.html):
- Brute-force programming 
- Neural Networks
- Crowdsourcing
- AJAX/HTML5
- The Cloud
- Statistics
